Tic Tac Toe: bottom left = exit program, top right = open music player

By pressing on either the red "X" or "O" buttons above the grid, you can select to be either player O or player X.
(Whichever symbol you choose goes first)
(2 players playing on the same device)

Which ever symbol's turn it is, will turn green.

When the game resets / before the beginning of the game, if you select the AI HARD or AI EASY you can play against an AI, AI Easy is completely random, while AI Hard has a fair difficulty, but is beatable.

(The AI is programed to take time between turns to not hurt your feelings)
(Player will always go first)
